# Logline_Generator

## What is it?
This is a simple web application that helps writers generate loglines for their stories. A logline is a brief summary of a story that captures its essence and hook. It typically consists of one or two sentences that convey the main character, the goal, the conflict, and the stakes of the story. A well-crafted logline can help writers pitch their stories to agents, producers, and publishers.

The Logline Generator provides several logline templates based on popular genres such as action, romance, comedy, horror, and drama. The user can select a template and fill in the blanks with their own story elements, such as character names, occupations, goals, obstacles, and twists. The generator then produces a logline based on the user's inputs.

The Logline Generator also allows the user to save their generated loglines and input values in the browser's local storage, so that they can access them later or share them with others. The user can download a .txt file of their loglines or clear their saved data by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

You can download a .txt file of your saved loglines by clicking on the "Download Loglines" button. This will create a file with one logline per line.

## Tech Used
The Logline Generator is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Bootstrap for the layout and styling, and jQuery for the DOM manipulation and event handling. It also uses the browser's local storage API to save and retrieve data. The generator is fully responsive and can be used on desktop and mobile devices.
